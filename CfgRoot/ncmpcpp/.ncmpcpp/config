## Changing it is useful if you want to store

## line setting for alternative location to config
## file which defines that while launching ncmpcpp.

## Directory for storing downloaded lyrics. It
## defaults to ~/.lyrics since other MPD clients
## (eg. ncmpc) also use that location.

##### music visualizer #####
## Note: In order to make music visualizer work you'll
## need to use mpd fifo output, whose format parameter
## has to be set to 44100:16:1 for mono visualization
## or 44100:16:2 for stereo visualization. Example
## configuration (it has to be put into mpd.conf):
audio_output {
	type            "fifo"
	name            "myfifo"
	path            "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
	format          "44100:16:2"
