blueHeart (kind of) for iceWM
-----------------------------

INTRODUCTION

I love blueHeart; unfortunately, my poor little box 
can't quite handle E, so I switched over to icewm when
I found out about it.

I began "porting" blueHeart to iceWM and learning GIMP
at more or less the same time.  Lots of little problems
(the biggest, of course, being that the theme doesn't
look a whole lot like the theme for E :) ... but the
end result is something that's pleasing enough for _my_
eye. :)



INSTALLATION

I'm not sure if this will work _perfectly_ for everyone
else, but as far as I know, put untar the puppy in your
~/.icewm/themes directory.  Then, switch themes to
blueheart. :)

I've been successfully running this theme on icewm
0.9.57 (and the last few versions before) for about the
last two (?) months or so without any difficulties.  I
can report that it works fine with icewm 1.0.0 now that
I've installed it. :)
