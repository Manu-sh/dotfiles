This is my first theme for the Ice Windowmanager.

The buttons (close, minimize etc) and the handles are taken from
the SteelSky-theme for KDE by rflemming@iname.com, and modified.

The "startbutton" and "windowbutton" are taken from the
TechnologicEnvy-theme and are heavily modified.

Have a good time!
