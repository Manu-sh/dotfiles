ABOUT 
	Aeteria is the result of an effort of making an Icewm theme
	which would look well with bright (or at least not completly
	dark) window contents (e.g. gtk widgets). Aeteria features
	pixmap window borders, modified mail-notifier pixmaps, nice
	background image and coherent overall appearance. It comes in
	three flavours (varying by menu background color and titlebar
	button placement) and with three background pixmaps (800x600,
	1024x768 and 1280x1024). It was made from scratch using GIMP
	and Moonlight Atelier on a Debian GNU/Linux box.

BUGS 
	For the sake of smallness, the background pixmaps are trimmed
	down to 64 colours, thus making dithering visible (although
	not totally disturbing :).

COMMENTS
	If you have any, share them with me.
