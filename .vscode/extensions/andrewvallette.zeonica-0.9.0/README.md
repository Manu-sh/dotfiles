# Zeonica 0.9.0

Zeonica is a colorful and (hopefully) aesthetically-pleasing original dark theme designed by Andrew Vallette for Visual Studio Code.

This is one of the first public releases of Zeonica, so it is certainly possible that some issues exist. If you do encounter something that doesn't look quite right, please feel free to let me know (see Contact section below).

## Coloring Issues

In order to create the best possible experience, Zeonica contains over 100 language-specific coloring rules. Nevertheless, shortcomings in various language grammars still prevent some source files from being displayed as intended. These issues cannot currently be addressed without improved language grammars.
